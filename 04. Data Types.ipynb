    "    A data type is a classification that specifies the kind of data a variable can hold and determines the operations that can be performed on that data. \n",
    "    \n",

    "**Why Use Data Types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data types make it easier for us to organize and work with data. Whether you’re counting numbers, storing text, or keeping track of true/false conditions, there’s a data type for that!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data types ensure that data is stored in a structured and efficient way, allowing for consistent interpretation and processing by the computer."
